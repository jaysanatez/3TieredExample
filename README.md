### Build Instructions

- Open the visual studio project file
- Open up the package manager console (Tools > Nuget Package Manager > Package Manager Console)
- Run `Update-Database`
- Launch in a web browser via Visual Studio

### Notes

- Not using dependency injection (yet)
- No unit tests are included (yet)
- View files are verbose, will be soon refactored
- More routes and functionality to come
- Just focus on the Controllers/Services/Repositories layers and the MVC basics
